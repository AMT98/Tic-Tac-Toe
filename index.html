<!-- if x wins then change it so that player O doesnt put down their mark  check -->
<!-- create a function where it chooses playerGame mode (single or multiplayer) -->
<!-- maybeeeeee create a function where it checks if x is about to win and add "O" to that index to prevent winning. -->



<!-- make a function where it guesses the next best move by looping through the board
check if player 1's move is a move where they are about to win else,
if a move causes the computer to win, place it, or random move. -->


<!-- TIC-TAC-TOE
As users playing a two player game we want to:

enter our names and have them displayed CHECK
have our order chosen for us by the game CHECK
take turns placing our marks in empty spaces CHECK
not be able to place our marks in an occupied space CHECK
be told when a move causes a player to win, or to draw
start the game over without having to reset the browser

As a user playing a one player game I want to:

see the name 'Computer' displayed as my opponent
have the Computer player make moves as if it were a human player with the correct mark in an empty space

As a user playing a single player game I would be delighted to:

have the Computer make 'better-than-guessing' choices when placing a mark on the board
set the board size myself ("wider" or "taller" than 3x3) -->






<!-- Figure out how to assign X and O's to player 1 and player 2 then switch.
when switching, change the bg color of the player 1 and player 2 to showcase whose turn it is
Loop through the board to set conditions to if empty and clicked fill it with X or O
figure out how to showcase the winner and increment the score 
maybe add audio or gif to showcase winner 
clear the board but keep the Scores incremented -->

<!-- 
  1st function: window onload the form loads
  2nd. submitbtn from the form clears the board if player names are entered
  2b. selects the starting player by changing bg color to gray
  3. showcase quick pop up with who won
  4. startGame loops over the boxes and adds a event listener to each box
  5. each box clicked adds x or o to the board in turn
  5b. checks if its tied
  5c. checks if the winning combo occured or not and displays who won
  6. winGame function checks for all the possible winning combos
  7. resetBtn onclick clears the board to start a new game and changes the bg color to gray of the player whose turn it is
